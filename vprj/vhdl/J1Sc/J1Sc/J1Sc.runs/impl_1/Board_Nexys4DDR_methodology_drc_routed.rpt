2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell core/jtagIface_jtagArea_jtag/buffers_0_i_1, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) core/bufferCC_4/buffers_0_reg/PRE, core/bufferCC_4/buffers_1_reg/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-6#1 Warning

Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-6#2 Warning
Timing of a block RAM might be sub-optimal
